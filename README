	exaMD - A scalable proto-app library for molecular dynamics
        -----------------------------------------------------------

Full details of this library are given in the User Guide, DOC/exaMD.pdf.

In the top level directory are three sub-directories (SRC, LIB and DOC), 
a Makefile, source files exaMD.f90 and user_func.f90, and this README.
The SRC directory contains all source files that get compiled to 
form the exaMD library, 'LIB/libexaMD.a'.

Usage
-----

* Set-up your Makefile for the appropriate compiler and location of METIS.

* To compile in this top level directory, just type:

	make

* Run using 

	mpirun -np <n> ./exaMD [flags]
	
  where [flags] are
  
   -atoms    :  specify the (maximum) number of atoms to be used
   -sparse   :  load a specified file	
   -overlap  :  use the alternative communication-computation overlap method
   -write    :  write out the generated positions for later reuse 

* The source file 'exaMD.f90' contains an example driving program that 
  calls the library.
  
* The force function calculated is specified by the user at this top 
  level.  A simple example is given in 'user_func.f90'.

This proto-app library was written by Chris Goodyer and subsequently modified
by Jon Gibson, both of the Numerical Algorithms Group. The work was funded by 
the European Union's Seventh framework Programme for research, technological 
development and demonstration under grant agreement No. 610741.
